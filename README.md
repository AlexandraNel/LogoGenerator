# Logo Generator
![License Badge](./license-badge.svg)
        
## Description

**Motivation:** Generating a command line application that can generate a simple logo, easily and efficiently, on demand. 

**The Why:** This project allows a quick logo to be generated when working with code for any given project. 

**Problem Solved:** When working with clients on branded websites and applications, or creating templated applications, a logo can be generated as an svg and used immediately. This avoids the need to utilise non scaleable pngâ€™s, wait for client assets, or utilise graphic design software. This generated logo can then be used as a permanent fixture or temporarily 

**Lessons:** This project allowed me to explore jest and testing processes. It also allowed me to explore SVG rendering and using modular classes

## Installation
User must have Node.

inquirer v8.2.4 must be installed in the terminal (npm i inquirer@8.2.4)\
inquirer maxlength must be initialised in the terminal (npm add inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt)\
for testing, jest must be installed in the terminal (npm i jest)


## Usage
- Initialise the folder LogoGenerator in your chosen code editor.
- Within the terminal (we used git bash) to start the logo  prompts. 
- Prompts will then guide you through a series of choices.
